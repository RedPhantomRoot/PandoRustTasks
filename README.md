# PandoRustTasks
This is a program written in Rust to manage your tasks (ToDo List)

### Note
For now, this program is using http request. However as you can see, this program sends password to server so https request shoud be adopted.<br>
If your server has valid domain and SSL is configured, please change http request to https request. You need to change port number in index.js.
